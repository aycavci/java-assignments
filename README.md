# Java assignments
Hey everyone!

I was able to find some of the Java assignments that I did during my bachelors degree. I believe that they will be very helpful for you to understand some of the concepts better by challenging you a little bit :)  As you can see, there are four folders that covers some of the topics that you learned till (including) lecture 14 in CODEGYM. In each folder, there are several small assignments (some of the easier, some of them harder). 

You can implement assignments in two ways:

1) Each assignment is prepared using [ACM Java Task Force](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/). So, if you want to use their UI and the .java file inside src folder (which points that where you need to write the code), you need to import acm.jar from the hyperlink or COMP130-Libs.zip (which contains acm libraries) to your working environment (in your case it is IntelliJ). If you manage to do it successfully, when you import the projects, they should run without errors.

2) Each assignment comes with a pdf file or in-code comment inside .java file that explains how your program supposed to run/look like. You can basically write your own program according to how it is described in its pdf file without using any of the libraries that are mentioned above. I believe this option will save sometime and challenge you to write your own program from scratch, which is a good practice :)

I will not reveal the solutions at this point, just try your best, we will discuss them later :)

Good luck & success!
